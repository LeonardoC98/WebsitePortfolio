      "text": "A dungeon-based action RPG that focuses on replayability through a unique progression system. Players hunt specific enemies to master their drop tables and can reset their character levels to gain permanent skill masteries. This creates a deep progression loop where knowledge and strategy matter more than raw stats."

Creating a difficulty curve that accommodates both new and mastered players. Designing enemy encounters that remain interesting even after players have mastered their patterns and drops."
