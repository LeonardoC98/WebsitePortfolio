    "intro": "Developing game-related mechanics such as power scaling and gameplay systems is an extremely exciting and enjoyable activity. The impact of progression and gameplay loops on player enjoyment should not be underestimated. The same game, depending on its design, can determine whether a player plays for half an hour or half a day, simply based on whether it includes a well-designed weapon upgrade system. Progression should not be too harsh, as this can discourage players, but it should also not be too easy, since players like to show off the equipment they worked hard to earn. I have played many games, and for me, these kinds of systems were often a deciding factor in whether I continued playing a game or not.",
